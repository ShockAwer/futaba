# Futaba Channel Source Code
The original unedited source code for Futaba Channel. This version uses no MySQL, which means you do not need to set up a database for it.
## Setup 
Run a 2003 era version of XAMPP, or any web server running PHP 5, and put futaba.php in the website folder. Make the website folder write accessible to everyone (CHMOD 777). Then, make two folders: **src** and **thumb**. Make both of those folders write accessible to everyone (CHMOD 777).
Go to futaba.php on the website that you are hosting. It should intitalize it. Congrats, you've setup a Futaba Channel instance.
